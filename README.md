# Siyi's Portfolio-website

# Primary Goals
The goal of this project is to create a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap that showcases my background, experiences, and skills as a software engineer.
Through this project, I aimed to:
1. Build a professional online presence: present my background, contact info, projects, and technical expertise in a clean, accessible layout.
2. Demonstrate front-end fundamentals: apply semantic HTML, responsive design, and CSS styling principles to create a structured and visually engaging site.
3. Practice modern web design patterns: implement patterns such as a fixed navigation bar, timeline section, and contact form.
4. Enhance interactivity and user experience: include a modal contact form, hover animations, and smooth scrolling navigation.
5. Develop familiarity with Git and version control: practice iterative commits for each design change and maintain organized code structure.
